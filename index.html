    <h1>Essam Aljahmi Personal Portfolio</h1>
    <h3>Short Pitch</h3>
    <p>For my final, I would like to work on a site for my portfolio to showcase my experience and work to future employers.</p>
    <h3>Long Pitch</h3>
    <p>I currently am studying Media and Information with a focus in Film and TV production. This website will showcase my work experience within the entertainment industry along with my portfolio work for projects that I have directed, produced, and edited. The approach to building my website is to have it be relative to the work in media production. With a range of experience and work from, working for multicam production to producing my own work, the main goal of the website is to showcase my skills as best as possible.</p>
